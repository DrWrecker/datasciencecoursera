For Coursera Data Science course

About Me: I’m a chemist by education - first synthetic organic chemistry, then organometallic, then biochemistry and cell biology now pharmaceutical chemistry and pharmacology (I'm not really that restless; I just like to stay employed). I’ve worked in academia and industry for many years. These courses are a way to challenge myself and revitalize my interest in science and technology.
