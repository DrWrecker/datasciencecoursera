Removed old file & repo. Starting over.

For Coursera Data Science course

About Me: Iâ€™m a chemist by education - first synthetic organic chemistry, then organometallic, then biochemistry and cell biology then pharmaceutical chemistry and pharmacology (I was not really that restless; I just liked to stay employed). I worked in academia and industry for many years. These courses are a way to challenge myself and revitalize my interest in science and technology. I am retired now and using these courses as a way to engage my brain.
